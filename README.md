Code test for Blue Gravity Studios

Request:

- Ensure that the prototype is designed in 2D, as 3D designs and prototypes are not relevant to this particular interview. Additionally, make both the executable and Unity project available on Github for us to review your code and progress.
- For this task, create a functional clothes shop within a simulation game reminiscent of 'The Sims' and 'Stardew Valley'. The game should feature a top-down view like Stardew Valley, not a side-scrolling, platformer, or bird's-eye view.
- Include a player character capable of walking and interacting with the game world.
- Required features: shopkeeper interaction, buying/selling items, item icons, item prices, and the ability to equip purchased outfits, which should be visible on the character.
- Design a suitable UI for this prototype.
- You may use pre-made art assets or create your own for this task.
- If incorporating pre-written code from other projects, please specify which sections are from those projects, as we want to understand what was written during the interview period.
- **The game should be executable and uploaded to Github** to facilitate easy playtesting.
- Please check and make sure that the link is set to public and not private.
- Please provide 300-word documentation explaining the system, your thought process during the interview, and your personal assessment of your performance. Attach this as a PDF file to Github.
- Aim to deliver the highest quality game possible, as quality is a priority for our team.

As an additional resource, we have included some **optional asset** for you to use if needed. You can find it at them on these links:
